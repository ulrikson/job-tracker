# Job Application Tracker

## Overview
A full-stack application designed to replace a manual CSV workflow for tracking job applications. This project serves as a practical learning vehicle to master the Node.js ecosystem, transitioning from a PHP/Laravel background.

## The "Why"
This project bridges the gap between a **Laravel/Vue** background and the **Node.js/React** ecosystem. The goal is to build a production-grade full-stack app to learn:
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (conceptually similar to Laravel's Eloquent).
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router) and Tailwind CSS.
- **Concepts:** RESTful API design, JWT authentication, and Type Safety with TypeScript.

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express (Backend) / Next.js (Frontend)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Language:** TypeScript (End-to-End)

## MVP Features
- **Authentication:** Secure login via JWT.
- **Dashboard:** Unified view of all job applications.
- **CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete application entries.
- **Tracking:** Status updates, "Vibe" ratings (1-5), and date tracking.

## Development Philosophy
"Keep it simple. Get it working. Polish later."
Focusing on core functionality and learning the patterns of the new stack.
