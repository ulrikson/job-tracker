## How to Use AI Specifically

Good prompts:

- "Explain how JWT middleware works in Express"
- "What's the Prisma pattern for updating a record with relations?"
- "Show me the TypeScript type for this React component"

Bad prompts:

- "Build my entire application"
- "Fix this" (without trying first)
- "Write this function" (when you should try it)

Best prompt:
> "I'm trying to [X], here's my attempt [code]. It's not working because [error]. What am I missing?"
